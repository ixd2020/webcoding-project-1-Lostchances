          The “piecita”, or the “closet” in his native town in Argentina, is the room where the young creator would disappear to work with balsa wood, drawing and carving those little models that would one day turn to his eyes as the most beautiful cars in the world. That was in Casilda, where, on the 10        </p>

          As a child, Horacio used to spend his time at the shop of Tito Ispani, a local modeler working on naval and aeronautical projects, trying to learn all the secrets regarding the finishing techniques of the fragile wood and on the mistery of his perfect Duco paint.

      <h1>"Gustavito" and the minibike.</h1>
        <h2>Horacio Pagani was about fourteen years old when he got a Sachs Televel engine from the 50s as a gift, damaged and out of use. Together with his friend Gustavo Marani, "Gustavito", they were planning to build a go-kart as they shared the same passion for cars, thus they went to Carcarañà, a small village in the surroundings, to purchase four small wheels. When they realized that with one single go-kart they couldn’t have fun together, they soon gave way to the project of two minibikes.</h2>

       Gustavo managed to find another engine, a Deem 48 cc, the same one that was mounted at the time on the Italian bikes, in Legnano. The Marani family owned a workshop, which became the place where the two friends used to meet to build their minibikes. The frames were very similar, but the engines were very different: Horacio’s was a 125 cilinders, while his friend’s one was a 48 cilinders.
