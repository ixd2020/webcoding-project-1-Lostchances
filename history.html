                <p>The story of Pagani is as fascinating and unique as the cars themselves. Horacio was 12 years old when he saw his first race, a Mercedes driven by what would be his childhood hero, Juan Manuel Fangio. Juan's racecraft left a deep impression on him, as Horacio grew up dreaming of creating the perfect sports car.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the years went by, Horacio developed an interest in design and enjoyed the challenges posed by discovering new technical solutions. As a young boy, he often observed the racing cars he sees &amp; carved them out of balsa wood in his free time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With extraordinary determination and vision, Horacio rose through the ranks, landing himself at a dream job of his as a composite engineer at Lamborghini. When he proposed to Lamborghini about making a car with a new material, Lamborghini refused. This signaled the end of his career, that led to him founding and establishing his own composites company, Modena Design.

                    In 1991, he went out on his own with his own consultancy called Modena Design which still exists today. It is a firm focused on making carbon fiber composites for Formula One cars and clients like Daimler, Ferrari and Aprilia . Soon afterwards, in 1992 Pagani Automobili Modena was founded by Pagani.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1998, Horacio started funded his own project, "Project C12" exclusively by himself, aware that no one would believe in his project. The intention was to create a car so captivating on an emotional level that a customer would buy without even thinking.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today, Pagani has solidified itself as one of the world's most elusive &amp; exclusive car brands. His experience &amp; knowledge with carbon composites has gained the respect from his customers &amp; rival alike.
